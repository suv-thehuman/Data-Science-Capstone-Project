-Project Overview

Title: Prediction of Credit Card Fraud

Objective: The project aims to build a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a highly imbalanced dataset.

Dataset:

Source: Transactions by European cardholders in September 2013.

Volume: 284,807 transactions with 492 fraud cases.

Imbalance: Fraudulent cases represent only 0.172% of the data.


-Key Steps in the Process

Data Preprocessing:
Data Quality Checks: Ensured no missing values and corrected any inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Applied transformations to extract meaningful features.

Balancing the Data: Addressed class imbalance through techniques like oversampling/undersampling.

Model Building:

Train/Test Split: Performed a strategic split to optimize model training and evaluation.

Model Selection: Experimented with various classification algorithms to find the best fit.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuned model parameters to improve accuracy and robustness.


-Results and Next Steps

Evaluation Metrics:

Used precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess model performance.


-Outcome:

Successfully developed a model with high precision and recall, effectively identifying fraudulent transactions.
